3-line and 6-line shared anchor systems in deep water: OpenFAST model
This repository contains OpenFAST v3.3.0 inputs files for 3-line and 6-line shared anchor systems using the IEA 15 MW reference turbine on the VolturnUS semisubmersible platform. 10 MW spar.
The original input files are based on the repository found here:
https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-15-240-RWT
The OpenFAST input files are found in the input_files directory. Within this folder, they are organized into:
3line: files for the 3-line system specifically
6line: files for the 6-line system specifically
common_files: ElastoDyn and WaterKin files used for both systems, as well as the MoorDyn files for all systems and load cases.

Within the 3line and 6line folders, subfolders exist for a 0deg analysis and a WWC analysis. Each folder contains subfolders for three IEC design load cases: DLC 1.6, DLC 6.1, and SLC. 

The results folder contains Matlab .mat files of the mooring lines and anchor loads for both 0deg and sweep.
